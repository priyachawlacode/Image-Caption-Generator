# Image-Caption-Generator

Whenever we see an image, we are able to tell what that image is about, but can a computer tell what the image is representing? 
There are techniques to extract some information from images. Also there are some techniques which can convert a given set of strings to meaningful statements. In this project we are trying to combine these two techniques to make an attempt for providing a meaningful description of a image through computer program.

This can ease the human work of exploring through a large chunk of images for finding a particular image. Also, it can provide description to image, easing human labour of naming them. Because of their description it can be used to categories the images too.
By Further Development, it can help visually impaired peoples by giving them audio description. It can process the images clicked at location not safe for humans. It can improve search engines for function with images. There can be multiple other dimensions too. With this in mind we are trying to create this project and learn about the various possibilities and techniques.


Literature Survey :- 
1) Automatic Caption for news images - Yansong Feng
2) Tag Clustering algorithm LMMSK - Jing Yang and Jun Wang
3) Neural Caption Generation for news images - Vishwash Batra, Yulan He, George Vogiatis
